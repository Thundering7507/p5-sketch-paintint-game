# p5-sketch-paintint-game
just for the user to know, you use z,x, and c to make the amount of red green and blue higher. you can also use v, b, and n to lower the amount of the colors. Finally you ca use p, and r to pause and resume your painting. This is my first official code, i might upgrade it sometime in the future but, for now please enjoy my sketch
